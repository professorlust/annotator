dear local newspaper caps1 i have found that many experts say that computers do not benifit our society in some cases this is true but in most cases studdies show that computers can help people while nothing beats talking in person computers can get really close such examples are webcams or e mail percent1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for reasearch or to help find good books also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide caps2 people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist person1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write talk or write back for much cheaper almost every single event i go to is planed on a computer by communication such as e mail caps2 a student ever needs homework because lam out sick or needs help studying for a test then contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them always e mail even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people the president of the post office person2 said caps3 would be imposible to get mail to our coustmers caps2 caps3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is caps4 that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist caps2 caps3 were not for the moder communication abilities that computer provid us because information can be commucated so quick so can reasearch when the country of location2 took a pole percent2 of people used computer for any type of reasearch of those percent3 were students currently in school and percent4 of them have good grades when the same survey was taken in the location1 percent5 of people used computers fore reasons and percent2 were students who had good grade caps2 caps3 were not posible for me to access documents in the caps5 caps6 online i probably would not have gotten an a on my caps7 assignment could you amagine caps2 suddenly your newspaper reporters couldn t use the internet to work on their reports the articles would probably be num1 after the events occur most buissness including the newspaper use the internet to advertise shop or read the association of organization1 reported that in percent1 of organization1 used a website and of them percent5 were in good positions the president of caps8 num2 imports said that they use an online catalouge because caps3 is cheaper but they can also promote that caps3 is to save trees or for the castomer s convinence small organization1 can make websites to promote them selves and explain their star to potential coustomers person3 the owner of organization2 s said that the internet saved her resturant caps2 caps3 wer not for the internet num3 more people would be jobless in location3 in conclusion computer help everyday people and without them most convinences would not exist they help communicate around the world computers help people reaserch subjects for school reports and they make the current economy get better everyday in moderation computers are the most useful tool out there
dear location1 i know having computers has a positive effect on people the computers connect families contain information which is great for peoples education and are very conveint computors are a step into the future and we should take advantage of it first off the internet or e mail will help family members connect my family which lives num1 hours away by car love to talk with me by e mail this helps me connect with my family and is just another reason why we should have computors another reason that includes family is when the family is just sitting around and are calling everywhere just to find a board game it would just be easier to go online to find it this way it would be quick and easy to find that one board game the last reason why a computer would help a family is if a family wants to get in to any kinds of activities and they need the number they could just go online on the internet the family could find the numbers the and some information about it this way more and more families can do activities together as one can see the computer is bringing more and more families together an other reason why the computers are good for society is educations with information at the tip of your fingers more and more people will want to learn now a days people try to find the out but will all the tools on the computers mae people get the education secondly computers are another way to go to collage if you arn t up to going to school collage because your sick you wouldn t have to miss anything because with a click of a button you will have the materials needed for what was missed lastly everyone knows that in location2 most classrooms can t afford one computer the children want computors so hard if they were to get one it would change so much they would be able to learn so much more than before the children could lean about different countries far away as a result computers would improve the way we learn the last reason why computers are so helpful is convience now a say the world is crazy so if we don t have to go out or talk to someone we won t the computer will offer the ability to confrence will other people so that there would be communication between work parttners with the ability to talk with another for work would make us a lighter nation this is only one of the many reasons computers are very conviente subssiquently computers are conviente because you could book flights vacations rentals and much more with a click of a button you should be going to caps1 or a nice vacation
dear location1 i think that computers have a negative affect on us how many people have acess to a camputer daily in america num1 and how many people go on at least an hour a num2 that means that num3 people cant exercise are wasting many are have the posibility of physical caps1 that sound good to you think of everything you done when you write a letter i got up and got all the materials and sit back down after in done writing have to put all the materials away and then put the letter in the mailbox and walk all the way back well this is what i had to do now think how you write an email sitdown and move your fingers do you see the difference caps2 instead of getting a good walk to your friends house to talk to you just in him er did you know that you can literally but from on your computer instead of around with this that can add anything you your computer gives away information they information lead to that and then everthing you have wouldbe gone all this so you can go online believe it or not you can phisically get hurt for being on the computer to long num4 thing is that when you at a computer caps2 what happened to my grandpa is that when you are in a wood chair all day you can get ardthritis in your muscle caps3 thing th
did you know that more and more people these days are depending on computers for their safety natural education and their social life in my opinion the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society initially ones safety while using a computer is at risk to begin when someone is talking to another on a computer they month1 never know who is at the other end of it for example caps1 a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her it could be a predator she will never know unless they meet us somewhere at this point it maybe too late moreover studies show that percent1 of people s information is more widely exposed in the last num1 years due to the new chat websites such as myspace and facebook in these websites people share their information with this their safety is at risk finally people should stop using computers as much as they are now in order to keep their safety safe furthermore enjoying nature is a must in our world full of immense landscapes wide waters dense forests and lush valleys caps1 you depend on your computer to teach you about the world you should cease this use one must actually be outside experiencing the feel the smell and even the taste of nature a recent study shows that people who actually went to the grand canyon could write a num1 page essay on what they had learned the people who didn t go and simply read information off their computer could not write this much finally society needs to back away from their computers and stop into thirdly a person s social life could be ruined from the use of computers for many reasons one reasons for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending time with their family and friends sure you can chat with people online but that s nothing like chatting in person there is no need to talk to a friend or family member online when you could do it in person finally caps1 someone takes an embarrasing picture of you and puts it on their computer it is there forever thus you can lose friends whether you re the person in the picture or the addict who put the picture on with this you can easily ruin your family social life by using your computer too often how would you feel caps1 it was your fault that someone s safety is at risk wouldn t you rather enjoy nature in person instead of which it on your computer and not get the fall effect couldn t you talk to your friends and family in person rather than ignore them to use your computer there are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society i encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life
percent1 of people agree that computers make life less complicated i also agree with this using computers teaches hand eye coordination gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and lets people talk online with other people i think that these are all very important why wouldn t you want to have strong hand eye coordination i think this a very important skill computers help teach hand eye coordination and they keep it strong while you re looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go good hand eye coordination is used for a lot of things mostly everything if you play some sports like baseball hand eye is one of the most important elements why not make that stronger off of the feild also hand eye can be used to organization1 while taking notes hand eye is involved with almost everything you do you can t have a poor hand eye coordination or else you won t be able to function properly num1 out of num2 doctors agree that hand eye very important for healthy living i love to travel but i want to know about the place i m going to before i get on the phone to go there said person1 a science teacher at organization1 he feels the way i m sure a lot of people feel they want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current the computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world some books don t offer as much information or they need to be updated computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions no one wants to be ignorant right people want to know what s going on in the world quick and easy the computer does this i remember when i was about num2 our phone broke in our house we couldn t go out and get one right away either the only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer the computer made it easier to e mail everyone and tell them why we weren t answering our house phone this happens more often than you think people need to communicate through computer a lot at work if you need to talk to an employee or co worker and you can t leave your desk you can just e mail the information to them num4 out of num2 employees say that it is much faster and easier to e mail information as opposed to talking them on the phone or in person a lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier computers teach hand eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people the most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people you can make a difference in the way people feel about computers write to your local newspaper it s now or never

in the location1 we have the technology of a computer some say that the computers are good for the society i disagree i believe that it is bad for a few reasons some of the reasons are obesity cramps more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying first if people don t get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity think of it this way if you watch a kid that didn t have to go to school his entire life and he started off at num1 pounds the only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight next tip top tip top that s all you hear when a kid is on the computer caps1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don t get off about on a school night these are the kids that are caps1 likely to get bad cramps they get the cramps form typing to fast hard and too long they also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can t because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere there s also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off the reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn t like it this happens maybe close to percent1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online this is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people the last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid well i have and it s not nice and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he she month1 get cyberbullied because he s not smart enough or if he she don t have the money to go to school the cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online there is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food they month1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school in conclusion these are only a few ways that computers effects people the obesity cramps sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it s not fun to get done to you now it s your turn to tell us what you think about the computers do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with
